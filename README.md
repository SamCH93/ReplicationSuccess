# ReplicationSuccess

## Notes on `conversionHelpers.R`:
* input tests are incomplete. 
* in what way should the functions be vectorized?
* why does the documentation `ci2p()` not mention the alternatives 'less' and 'greater'?
* it could make sense the describe these functions (`ci2se`, `ci2estimate`, `ci2z`, `ci2p`, `z2p`, `p2z`) in a single help file.
