# ReplicationSuccess

Provides utilities for the design and analysis of replication studies.
Features methods for both traditional methods based on statistical significance and
more recent methods such as the sceptical *p*-value as well as *p*-values derived
from the harmonic mean chi-squared test and the intrinsic credibility.
Contains datasets from four large-scale replication projects.
