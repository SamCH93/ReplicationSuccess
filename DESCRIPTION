Description: Contains utilities for design and analysis of replication studies. Traditional methods based on statistical signficance and confidence intervals, as well as more recently developed methods such as the sceptical p-value are included. Also provides functions to compute the p-value from the harmonic mean chi-squared test, the p-value for intrinsic credibility as well as the threshold for intrinsic credibility. Contains data sets from four large-scale replication projects.
