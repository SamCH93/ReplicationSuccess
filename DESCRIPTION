Description: Contains utilities for design and analysis of replication studies.
    Traditional methods based on statistical signficance and confidence intervals,
    as well as more recently developed methods such as the sceptical p-value are
    included. Also provides functions to compute the p-value from the harmonic
    mean chi-squared test, the p-value for intrinsic credibility as well as the
    threshold for intrinsic credibility. Contains data sets from four large-scale
    replication projects.
